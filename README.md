ThemeChanger
============

A python script that helps you change the theme of running programs. 

The script works by keeping a list of configuration files for different programs for different themes. 

##Usage
The script uses a python configuration file to do the work so you will need to create your own. Have a look at
```templateTheme.py``` and ```theme.py``` for details. 

Once you have created a good configuration, simply run the ```toggleTheme``` script and the magick will happen.
